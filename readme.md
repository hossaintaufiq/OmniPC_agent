# 🤖 OmniPC Agent

### A Multi-LLM AI Agent That Can Use a Computer Like a Human

OmniPC Agent is an **open-source AI agent for personal computers and laptops**.  
It is designed to understand human instructions, plan actions, and safely operate a computer — similar to how a human would.

This project is **experimental**, **community-driven**, and built **in public** for learning, research, and fun.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision

> Build an AI agent that can **think, plan, and act on a PC**, using multiple AI models, while keeping humans in full control.

---

## ❓ What Makes OmniPC Agent Different?

Most AI tools only chat.  
OmniPC Agent can:

- Understand complex tasks
- Break them into steps
- Choose the best AI model for reasoning
- Interact with files, browsers, and apps
- Show and explain every action it takes

---

## 🧠 Multi-LLM Powered

The agent combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs):

- GPT
- Gemini
- Grok
- DeepSeek

The agent intelligently:
- Routes tasks to the best model
- Cross-checks responses
- Uses fallback mechanisms

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Workflow
User → Desktop App → Agent Brain → LLMs → Tools → OS


Everything runs with **explicit user permission**.

---

## 🧩 Main Components

- **Desktop Application**  
  User interface, permissions, action visualization

- **Agent Core**  
  Task understanding, planning, memory, safety

- **Multi-LLM Orchestrator**  
  Model selection, response aggregation

- **Tool Layer**  
  File system, browser automation, app control

---

## 🔐 Safety Principles

- Human-in-the-loop by default
- No hidden actions
- Permission-based execution
- Transparent logs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

**Frontend**
- Electron / Tauri
- React

**Backend / Core**
- Python
- Node.js

**AI & Automation**
- OpenAI API
- Gemini API
- DeepSeek API
- Playwright / Selenium
